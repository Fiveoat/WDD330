    <h1>Week2</h1>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            From Mobile Master UX: Lessons on UX. Do mobile devlopment first when working on projects. First create the
            mobile verion & then scale it up to the desktop version. Will be more clean. Will be easier to use for a
            massive user base of mobile users. Will simplify your design by force. Make everything important reachable
            from the bottom. Make buttons & menus intuitive. Creating a better user experience == $$$. No long forms.
            Simplify form inputs. Don't use pop-ups. Get creative & accent page with ads with content being the main
            attraction, not other way around.
        </li>
        <li>
            From Javascript: Novice to Ninja. JavaScript has to be backwards compatible. Use AJAX to update small
            components of website. W3C creates web standards (This is the entitiy that also teaches JS, HTML, CSS I
            think through their site?). JavaScript is offically called ECMAScript. You can use REPL to code JavaScript
            in browser.

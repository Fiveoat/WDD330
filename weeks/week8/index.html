    <h1>Week 8</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World</h4>
        <li>Use transform in CSS to do transformations.</li>
        <li>Common transformations:</li>
        <li>translateX()</li>
        <li>translateY()</li>
        <li>scale()</li>
        <li>rotate()</li>
        <li>skew(x,y)</li>
        <li>You can also use transform-origin.</li>
        <li>Transitions</li>
        <li>transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all
            for all properties being the default</li>
        <li>You can chain multiple transitions.</li>
        <li>Important:</li>
        <li>transition-property</li>
        <li>transition-duration</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function</li>
        <li>transition-delay</li>
        <h4>Animations</h4>
        <li>Use @keyframes to create animations</li>
        <li>Define animations that can be used.</li>
        <li>animation-name: is used to attach an animation to an element</li>
        <li>animation-duration: the time an animation takes to complete one iteration</li>
        <li>animation-timing-function determines "how" the animation will progress over its duration</li>
        <li>animation-iteration-count: number of times the animation will run</li>
        <li>animation-fill-mode property defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the
            last animation iteration concludes</li>
        <li>example:
            .verbose {
            animation-name: appearDisappear;
            animation-duration: 300ms;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in;
            animation-iteration-count: 1;
            animation-direction: alternate;
            animation-delay: 5s;
            animation-fill-mode: backwards;
            animation-play-state: running;
            }</li>
        <h4>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
        <li>You can "draw" shapes and things with Canvas. </li>
        <li>Some browsers don't support canvas.</li>
        <li>Images can be inserted in the canvas.</li>
        <li>You can also manipulate video as well.</li>
        <li>SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics</li>
        <li>Vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down</li>
        <li>You can also create shapes with SVG</li>
        <li>You can apply animations to SVG</li>
        <li>add the draggable attribute to make images draggable</li>
        <li>You can use the dragover event handler to handle drag & drops onto.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have used Bootstrap before & I have heard of Tailwind (though I think this may be the answer). I have also
            learned grid & flexbox & Sass. I am curious if there is a framework or way that someone who dislikes working
            with CSS can still create nice, well designed web applications if they want to focus on backend or client
            side functionality.</li>
        <li>How often do high quality websites use SVG & canvas? Either or.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Week5</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Testing & Debugging</h3>
        <li>JavaScript is forgiving when it comes to errors, sometime causes to miss errors</li>
        <li>Failing silently can be bad.</li>
        <li>Strict mode can be good for finding warnings that don't break their code.</li>
        <li>Can use linting to find poorly written code. Imporve writing of code.</li>
        <li>alert() can be useful to visualize, but it is disouraged for debugging.</li>
        <li>Use console.log() & console.trace() instead.</li>
        <li>Set breakpoints to move through your code & pause at certain points.</li>
        <li>You can use constructors to create new errors / custom errors</li>
        <li>throw is the same as raise in Python</li>
        <li>try catch finallys = try except finally in Python</li>
        <li> ex: function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {} }“use strict”;try {return String(squareRoot(number));}
            catch(error) {return squareRoot(-number)+“i”;}}</li>
        <h4>Tests</h4>
        <li>Test-driven development (TDD) : writing tests before any code.</li>
        <li>4 Steps: writetests(that initially fail), write code to pass the tests, refactor, write more tests</li>
        <li>red-green-refactor</li>
        <li>Jasmine is one of the most popular JavaScript TDD frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How thorough is unit testing in most companies?</li>
        <li>How much longer does it take to write code with tests, than just the code?</li>
    </ul>
